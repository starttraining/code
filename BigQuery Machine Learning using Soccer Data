‚úÖ Why build a model like this?
üéØ 1. To estimate shot quality (Expected Goals - xG)
xG assigns a value between 0 and 1 to every shot, representing the likelihood that it results in a goal.
Coaches, analysts, and commentators use xG to understand how good a shot was, regardless of whether it went in.

üìä 2. More objective performance evaluation
Actual goals can be misleading due to luck or individual brilliance.
xG helps evaluate whether a team/player is creating high-quality chances.
For example: A striker scoring 2 goals from 0.5 xG is likely overperforming.

‚öôÔ∏è 3. To identify trends and inefficiencies
You can analyze what kinds of shots (angle, distance, type) are most likely to become goals.
It helps in strategy optimization: e.g. encouraging closer, better-angle shots.

üß† 4. To train predictive systems
The model can be integrated into a live match engine to show real-time xG estimates.
Helps with fan engagement, live commentary, or betting systems.

üöÄ Benefits:
Benefit	Explanation
Objective shot evaluation	Not all shots are equal. xG helps score chance quality.
Player analysis	Compare actual goals vs. expected goals to detect over/under performance.
Team tactics improvement	Inform coaching decisions on shot selection, buildup play, etc.
Fan engagement & storytelling	Adds depth to match commentary with predictive insight.
Scouting & recruitment	Evaluate players based on shot quality, not just goals scored.

In binary classification problems like your xG logistic regression model, Log Loss and ROC AUC are two critical metrics under Aggregate Metrics for evaluating model quality. Here's why they matter:

üìä Quick Comparison
Metric	  Goal	                        Ideal Value	  Your Model
Log Loss	Accurate probabilities	      Near 0	      0.3526
ROC AUC	  Accurate ranking (separation)	Close to 1	  0.7700

‚úÖ Summary
Use Log Loss when:
You care about probability calibration (important in xG models).
You're using the model output directly in decision-making.

Use ROC AUC when:
You want to evaluate ranking/separation power.
You're comparing models or tuning thresholds.

üîç What this means:
Logistic regression assigns weights to each input feature. These weights indicate how each feature affects the probability of the outcome (isGoal = true):
Positive weight ‚Üí Increases the likelihood of a goal
Negative weight ‚Üí Decreases the likelihood of a goal
Higher absolute value ‚Üí Greater impact on the prediction

üî¢ Coefficient Interpretation
Feature	      Category/Value	  Weight	  Interpretation
shotType	    Shot	            -1.297	  Basic shots have the lowest chance of scoring among types.
              Free kick shot	  -0.910	  Free kick shots are also less likely to score.
              Penalty	          +1.148	  Penalties have the highest probability of scoring.
shotDistance	(numeric)	        -0.051	  Every extra unit of distance from goal reduces goal probability.
shotAngle	    (numeric)	         +0.035	  Wider (more open) angles slightly increase goal probability.
__INTERCEPT__	‚Äî	                -1.089	  Baseline value when all features are 0 (not interpretable alone).
