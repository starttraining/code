In binary classification problems like your xG logistic regression model, Log Loss and ROC AUC are two critical metrics under Aggregate Metrics for evaluating model quality. Here's why they matter:

üìä Quick Comparison
Metric	  Goal	                        Ideal Value	  Your Model
Log Loss	Accurate probabilities	      Near 0	      0.3526
ROC AUC	  Accurate ranking (separation)	Close to 1	  0.7700

‚úÖ Summary
Use Log Loss when:
You care about probability calibration (important in xG models).
You're using the model output directly in decision-making.

Use ROC AUC when:
You want to evaluate ranking/separation power.
You're comparing models or tuning thresholds.

üîç What this means:
Logistic regression assigns weights to each input feature. These weights indicate how each feature affects the probability of the outcome (isGoal = true):
Positive weight ‚Üí Increases the likelihood of a goal
Negative weight ‚Üí Decreases the likelihood of a goal
Higher absolute value ‚Üí Greater impact on the prediction

üî¢ Coefficient Interpretation
Feature	      Category/Value	  Weight	  Interpretation
shotType	    Shot	            -1.297	  Basic shots have the lowest chance of scoring among types.
              Free kick shot	  -0.910	  Free kick shots are also less likely to score.
              Penalty	          +1.148	  Penalties have the highest probability of scoring.
shotDistance	(numeric)	        -0.051	  Every extra unit of distance from goal reduces goal probability.
shotAngle	    (numeric)	         +0.035	  Wider (more open) angles slightly increase goal probability.
__INTERCEPT__	‚Äî	                -1.089	  Baseline value when all features are 0 (not interpretable alone).
