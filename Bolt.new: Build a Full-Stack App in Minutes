Step 1: Get the core screens for the app
Build a simple Workout Tracker app where users can: 
- Log different types of workouts (exercise name, sets, reps, or duration) 
- View a history of all logged workouts 
- See a progress dashboard that summarizes their activity over time 

Step 2: Enhance the UI design
Make the workout tracker app visually appealing by updating the design. Specifically: 
- Add workout categories with clear icons 
- Improve the overall layout for better readability 
- Style the progress form to look clean and modern 
- Apply a consistent color scheme (e.g., calming blues and greens) 

Step 3: Integrate the workout app with Supabase
Let's add authorization and store data in Supabase: 
1. The user shouldnâ€™t see the main app UI if they are not logged in. 
2. Authorization will be based on username and password. 
3. Store login details, workout history, and personal preferences in Supabase tables. 
4. Build an edge function to securely handle workout-related queries. 
5. Store sensitive config values in the .env file. 
6. Do you need anything from me? 
7. Provide me with the SQL queries for creating the database tables.
