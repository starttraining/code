1. What are some ways to describe generative AI? Select three.
check
Generative AI works by using a machine learning model to learn patterns in data.
Correct! Generative AI works by using a machine learning model to learn the patterns and relationships in a dataset, and then uses the learned patterns to generate new content.
check
Generative AI is powered by foundation models (large AI models).
Correct! Generative AI is powered by foundation models that can perform many tasks, such as text summarization, Q&A, classification, translation, image generation, and more.
check
Generative AI is a technology that can produce various types of content, including text, and images.
Correct! Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data.

2. What are some features of Vertex AI? Select three.
check
Vertex AI is an open and integrated AI platform.
Correct! Vertex AI is an open and integrated AI platform that provides data scientists with tools for training, tuning, and deploying ML models. You can use open models in Vertex AI Model Garden leveraging Vertex AI infrastructure.
check
Vertex AI provides access to Gemini and other models.
Correct! Vertex AI provides access to Gemini and other models where you can prompt and test them with text, images, video, or code. From apps, developers can access the models using APIs. The Vertex AI Model Garden contains open models and a variety of first and third party models.
check
You can build AI Agents in Vertex AI.
Correct! With Vertex AI Agent Builder, you can create generative AI agents and applications grounded in your organizationâ€™s data.

3. Which statements about Flutter are correct? Select three.

Flutter is a no-code framework for developing apps without writing any code.
check
Flutter is a reactive, declarative UI framework.

Your score: 100% Passing score: 80%
Congratulations! You passed this assessment.
********************************************
Correct! Flutter is a reactive, declarative UI framework, where the developer provides a mapping from the application state to the interface state.
check
To develop a Flutter app, you create widgets in the Dart programming language.
Correct! In Flutter, you create widgets that are represented by immutable classes, and are used to configure a tree of objects. Widgets are the building blocks of a Flutter app's user interface.

With Flutter, you can build apps for multiple platforms from a single codebase.
 
4. Which statements regarding Gemini models are correct? Select two.
Gemini vision models can process input from image and text prompts.
Correct! The Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model is multimodal and can understand input from images, text, and code, and generates text output.

The Gemini 1.5 Pro model supports long context understanding up to the maximum input token limit.
Correct! This model supports long-context understanding with a 2M token context window. To process a prompt, generative AI models break down text and other data in a prompt into units called tokens. A token can be characters, words, or phrases and depends on the tokenizer used.

Part 2 Quiz
**************************************************************
1. What are the four main components in Vertex AI that are used to build Gen AI applications with Reasoning Engine?
check
Orchestration framework
Correct! Vertex AI includes the LangChain orchestration framework that allows you to create and manage AI agents, and ensure that data is passed correctly between the agents, LLMs, and tools.
Managed runtime
Correct! Vertex AI provides the Reasoning Engine managed runtime as a service that comes with security, privacy, observability, and scalability features.
check
Model
Correct! The model processes a prompt and provides a response. While processing a prompt, the model delegates certain tasks to the tools that you define.
check
Tools
Correct! You can define a set of tools that communicate with external APIs and provide them to the model.

2. What are some capabilities of Vertex AI Agent Builder? Select four.
check
You can control data privacy in your AI apps using Vertex AI Agent Builder.
Correct! Vertex AI Agent Builder offers built-in security, compliance, and governance features, allowing you to manage access and maintain data privacy in your AI apps.
check
Ground model output.
Correct! Using Vertex AI Agent Builder, you can ground model output with Google Search or with your own data.
check
Create AI agents with orchestration tools in Gen AI applications.
Correct! You can use Vertex AI Reasoning Engine with Function Calling to orchestrate model response in Gen AI applications.
check
You can design and implement conversational interfaces in your applications.
Correct! With Vertex AI Agent Builder tools, you can easily design and integrate a conversational user interface into your mobile, web, or other application.

3. What are some characteristics of AI Agent apps? Select two.
AI Agent apps use LLMs for reasoning and orchestration.
Correct! An AI Agent app uses the power of large language models for reasoning and orchestration with external tools to achieve a certain goal.
check
AI Agent apps help you to get responses that contain the latest information, and lower the risk of hallucination with Gen AI models.
Correct! Using AI Agent apps, you can ground a model with external data sources to get the latest information, and lower the risk of model hallucination.

4. What are some uses of Vertex AI Search? Select three.
To build search capabilities on your own data for your website or app.
Correct! With Vertex AI Search, you can quickly build a search app on your own data for your website or app.
check
To ground model output with your enterprise data.
Correct! To ground models in your enterprise data, you can use the RAG system from Vertex AI Search.
check
To generate recommendations on your own data.
Correct. With Vertex AI Search, you can build a generic recommendations app on your own data that can suggest content similar to the content that the user is currently viewing.
